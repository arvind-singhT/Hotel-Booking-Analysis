# Hotel-Booking-Analysis
In this Hotel Booking dataset I have drawn some major insights using Python, different python libraries(like Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly) and Jupyter notebook. 


The dataset contains data from two different hotels. One Resort hotel and one City hotel.

From the publication (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340918315191) we know that both hotels are located in Portugal (southern Europe) ("H1 at the resort region of Algarve and H2 at the city of Lisbon"). The distance between these two locations is ca. 280 km by car and both locations border on the north atlantic.

The data contains "bookings due to arrive between the 1st of July of 2015 and the 31st of August 2017".
Note: For most questions I will only use bookings that were not canceled, to get acutal guest numbers. As you will see, this is quite a big difference.

Topics covered and questions to answer from the data:

> Where do the guests come from?
 
> How much do guests pay for a room per night?
 
> How does the price per night vary over the year?
 
> What are the preference of guests?
 
> Which are the most busy month?
 
> How long do people stay at the hotels?
 
> Bookings by market segment
 
> ADR by market segment and room type
 
> How many bookings were canceled?
 
> Which month have the highest number of cancelations?

Plotly graphs are not visible on github. So here is the link through which the notebook can be viewed properly :
